\section*{Employment}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Basho Technologies}, Software Architect and Product Manager -- Cambridge, MA -- Jul 2011 - Present

I am currently a Product Manager for the Riak distributed NoSQL database at
Basho Technologies. In this role I am responsible for a clear and shared
definition of product direction.
balancing the demands and
long/short term goals of engineering, sales, professional services and the
executive-team against the needs of our customers and trends in the distributed
database market. I educate sales and marketing through presentations and
product comparisons and take part in customer visits and partner activity. I
put my diverse background (software engineering, architecture, mentorship,
product management, etc.) to work identifying and solving problems. Previous to
that role at Basho I was an Architect and a member of the Client Services team.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Oracle Corporation}, Product Manager -- Burlington, MA -- Feb 2006 - Mar 2011

Sleepycat Software was acquired in Feb of 2006 by Oracle and I transitioned
into the Embedded Global Business Unit (EGBU) responsible for edge, mobile and
embedded databases. There I continued in my role just as before, managing the
three products created at Sleepycat - Berkeley DB, Berkeley DB XML, and
Berkeley DB Java Edition.

\item {\it Sleepycat Software}, Software Engineer/Product Manager -- Boston, MA -- Jul 2002 - Feb 2006

Hired initially to do software engineering on Berkeley DB I later transitioned
in 2004 to the role of Product Manager. I reported into the office of the CTO
and worked with all parts of the organization, our partners and our board. I
was directly responsible for the success of our products in their respective
markets. I launched two highly successful products and continue to enhance and
maintain them today in this role.

\item {\it KnowNow}, Technical Alliance Manager -- Menlo Park, CA -- Dec 2000 - Jun 2002

Founded by Rohit Khare and Adam Rifkin I joined KnowNow as the fourth
employee. Together we pitched Kleiner Perkins. We were funded and worked at
first from the KP incubator offices on Sand Hill Road. Our primary
technological break through was AJAX (by another name) and some foundational
ideas behind REST. My role was to communicate and advocate the technical value
of the KnowNow Event Router and Micro-Server to strategic software integrators,
value-added resellers, and other channel partners. I accomplished this with a
mixture of sample code, on-site meetings and presentations.

\item {\it Primix Solutions}, Managing Consultant -- Watertown, MA -- Sep 1996 - Jun 1999

It was my responsibility to report to the CTO on cross-functional performance,
opportunities for strategic improvement, as well as to identify sub-par design
decisions across the 5-10 consulting engagements underway at any given time. In
this role I helped identify and foster open source frameworks, contribute to
the success of many engagements, interface with customers and communicate back
to the CTO and company leadership ways in which we could technically refine our
delivery process and build reliable systems on time, within budget.

\item {\it Sun Microsystems}, Member of Technical Staff (MTS-4) Software Engineer -- Bay Area, CA -- Jul 1999 - Nov 2000
I worked in a number of areas within Sun:
\begin{itemize}
\item Desktop Technologies - Adapting the NeXT Computer OpenStep software for use on Solaris 2.7
\item JavaSoft - Building office applications in the Java Applications Group
\item Market Development Engineering - Supporting the strategic database and ERP systems partners
\end{itemize}

\item {\it Marble Associates}, Managing Associate Consultant -- San Jose, CA then later Watertown, MA -- Aug 1993 - Aug 1996

Senior Consulting Engineer building NeXTSTEP applications, porting TCP/IP onto
OSI, and writing/delivering on SBIR grants. This small consulting firm
experienced a tragedy when 3 of 4 founders (CEO, CTO, CFO) died in a small
plane crash. This fractured the company, many left, I remained and helped to
re-assert our position as a viable firm.

\item {\it NeXT Computer}, Developer Support Team -- Redwood City, CA -- May 1992 - Sep 1992

Responsibilities included custom development and technical support for
strategic clients, sales support, and speaking and presenting. I worked to help
the strategic accounts port software to NeXTSTEP.
